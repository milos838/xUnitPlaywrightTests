# xUnitPlaywrightTests

- This repository contains a sample project demonstrating how to use xUnit with Playwright for end-to-end testing in a .NET environment.

- The objective is to show how to set up Playwright tests using xUnit, including the necessary configurations and dependencies.

- Test cases are written in C# and utilize Playwright to interact with web applications.

- Page objects are used to encapsulate the interactions with the web application, promoting maintainability and readability of the tests.

- Data-driven tests are implemented to demonstrate how to run the same test with different sets of data, enhancing test coverage and flexibility.

- The project includes examples of common testing scenarios, such as form submissions, navigation, and assertions on page content.
